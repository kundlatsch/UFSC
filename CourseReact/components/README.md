### Section 3

This section introduce the concept of React Component. In this example, we created a generic component to approve comments (used in a blog or forum, for example).

The style was powered by [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), and the comments data by [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/).
