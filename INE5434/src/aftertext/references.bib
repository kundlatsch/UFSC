abstract="Intelligent agents are a new paradigm for developing software applications. More than this, agent-based computing has been hailed as `the next significant breakthrough in software development' (Sargent, 1992), and `the new revolution in software' (Ovum, 1994). Currently, agents are the focus of intense interest on the part of many sub-fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. Agents are being used in an increasingly wide variety of applications, ranging from comparatively small systems such as email filters to large, open, complex, mission critical systems such as air traffic control. At first sight, it may appear that such extremely different types of system can have little in common. And yet this is not the case: in both, the key abstraction used is that of an agent Our aim in this article is to help the reader to understand why agent technology is seen as a fundamentally important new tool for building such a wide array of systems. More precisely, our aims are five-fold:                                  to introduce the reader to the concept of an agent and agent-based systems,                                                  to help the reader to recognize the domain characteristics that indicate the appropriateness of an agent-based solution,                                                  to introduce the main application areas in which agent technology has been successfully deployed to date,                                                  to identify the main obstacles that lie in the way of the agent system developer, and finally                                                  to provide a guide to the remainder of this book.

title="Active vision",
journal="International Journal of Computer Vision",
year="1988",
month="Jan",
day="01",
volume="1",
number="4",
pages="333--356",
abstract="We investigate several basic problems in vision under the assumption that the observer is active. An observer is called active when engaged in some kind of activity whose purpose is to control the geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus. The purpose of the activity is to manipulate the constraints underlying the observed phenomena in order to improve the quality of the perceptual results. For example a monocular observer that moves with a known or unknown motion or a binocular observer that can rotate his eyes and track environmental objects are just two examples of an observer that we call active. We prove that an active observer can solve basic vision problems in a much more efficient way than a passive one. Problems that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a passive observer become well-posed and linear for an active observer. In particular, the problems of shape from shading and depth computation, shape from contour, shape from texture, and structure from motion are shown to be much easier for an active observer than for a passive one. It has to be emphasized that correspondence is not used in our approach, i.e., active vision is not correspondence of features from multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here does not mean active sensing, and this paper introduces a general methodology, a general framework in which we believe low-level vision problems should be addressed.",

volume="42",
number="2",
pages="177--196",
abstract="Despite the recent successes in robotics, artificial intelligence and computer vision, a complete artificial agent necessarily must include active perception. A multitude of ideas and methods for how to accomplish this have already appeared in the past, their broader utility perhaps impeded by insufficient computational power or costly hardware. The history of these ideas, perhaps selective due to our perspectives, is presented with the goal of organizing the past literature and highlighting the seminal contributions. We argue that those contributions are as relevant today as they were decades ago and, with the state of modern computational tools, are poised to find new life in the robotic perception systems of the next decade.",

abstract="Some philosophers argue that the principles of human reasoning are impeccable, and that mistakes are no more than momentary lapses in ``information processing''. This article makes a case to the contrary. It shows that human reasoners commit systematic fallacies. The theory of mental models predicts these errors. It postulates that individuals construct mental models of the possibilities to which the premises of an inference refer. But, their models usually represent what is true in a possibility, not what is false. This procedure reduces the load on working memory, and for the most part it yields valid inferences. However, as a computer program implementing the theory revealed, it leads to fallacious conclusions for certain inferences---those for which it is crucial to represent what is false in a possibility. Experiments demonstrate the variety of these fallacies and contrast them with control problems, which reasoners tend to get right. The fallacies can be compelling illusions, and they occur in reasoning based on sentential connectives such as ``if'' and ``or'', quantifiers such as ``all the artists'' and ``some of the artists'', on deontic relations such as ``permitted'' and ``obligated'', and causal relations such as ``causes'' and ``allows''. After we have reviewed the principal results, we consider the potential for alternative accounts to explain these illusory inferences. And we show how the illusions illuminate the nature of human rationality.",

abstract = "Automated planning, the problem of how an agent achieves a goal given a repertoire of actions, is one of the foundational and most widely studied problems in the AI literature. The original formulation of the problem makes strong assumptions regarding the agent's knowledge and control over the world, namely that its information is complete and correct, and that the results of its actions are deterministic and known. Recent research in planning under uncertainty has endeavored to relax these assumptions, providing formal and computation models wherein the agent has incomplete or noisy information about the world and has noisy sensors and effectors. This research has mainly taken one of two approaches: extend the classical planning paradigm to a semantics that admits uncertainty, or adopt another framework for approaching the problem, most commonly the Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. This paper presents a complexity analysis of planning under uncertainty. It begins with the “probabilistic classical planning” problem, showing that problem to be formally undecidable. This fundamental result is then applied to a broad class of stochastic optimization problems, in brief any problem statement where the agent (a) operates over an infinite or indefinite time horizon, and (b) has available only probabilistic information about the system's state. Undecidability is established for policy-existence problems for partially observable infinite-horizon Markov decision processes under discounted and undiscounted total reward models, average-reward models, and state-avoidance models. The results also apply to corresponding approximation problems with undiscounted objective functions. The paper answers a significant open question raised by Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis [Math. Oper. Res. 12 (3) (1987) 441–450] about the complexity of infinite horizon POMDPs."

Adopting a probabilistic model complicates the definition of plan success: instead of demanding a plan that provably achieves the goal, we seek plans whose probability of success exceeds the threshold. In this paper, we present buridan, an implemented least-commitment planner that solves problems of this form. We prove that the algorithm is both sound and complete. We then explore buridan's efficiency by contrasting four algorithms for plan evaluation, using a combination of analytic methods and empirical experiments. We also describe the interplay between generating plans and evaluating them, and discuss the role of search control in probabilistic planning."

The autonomous behavior of an agent may be the consequence of a gap between physical processes and self-referential meaningful processing of information which is related but not determined by physical processes. This indeterminism can be reproduced in a cognitive architecture through the self-referential processing of information with consideration of itself as a meaningful model. We propose embodiment of cognitive architecture of autonomous intelligent agent as an artificial neural network with a feedback loop in meaningful processing of information."
