abstract = "Taking into account that the human intelligence is the only available intelligence we will find the functional relationship between neuronal processes and psychic phenomena to reproduce intelligence in artificial system. The autonomous behavior of an agent may be the consequence of a gap between physical processes and self-referential meaningful processing of information which is related but not determined by physical processes. This indeterminism can be reproduced in a cognitive architecture through the self-referential processing of information with consideration of itself as a meaningful model. We propose embodiment of cognitive architecture of autonomous intelligent agent as an artificial neural network with a feedback loop in meaningful processing of information."
